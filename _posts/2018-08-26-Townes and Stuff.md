Currently I am moving on to one of the final tasks, which is filling in the new townes(villages/camps/hamlets) and second stories of existing townes, with NPCs. This is not a technically difficult task, but to do it right, to fit in with the existing lore, plots etc., and to make it fun, etc., takes some thought.
So I have  found myself fooling about with the structure of the townes I have already made, to make the discovery and interaction with NPCs a little more exciting. I had built a base of villages/hamlets and second stories of townes that I thought was pretty decent, but they needed a bit of polish it seems.
Whilst polishing them I found myself tempted to make further changes to the default town levels. Currently the only changes I had made were to add ladders at strategic points to facilitate passage to the new upper and lower levels. However, to integrate the upper, and possibly, lower levels more smoothly, some changes may need to be made to the default, vanilla levels. I am not sure about this, as so far I have avoided nearly any interference with the default game, only adjusting things in one or two places in a way that affects the default content.

But...if I could modify the default 'main' levels in some of the new 3 level locations, I could have routes that wind their way through the 3 levels in complex ways, making exploring and finding secret passages even more rewarding.

So...should I do it...?
