This disk contains updates to the Windows libraries that were shipped with
the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (050-150) version 1.01. These
new libraries are compatible for use with the Microsoft C Compiler (version
4.0).  The old Windows libraries are only compatible with the previous version
(v. 3.0) of the Microsoft C Compiler.

This disk also contains a new version (5.00.12) of LINK4.EXE that is
compatible with the object module format (.OBJ) produced by the new
Microsoft C Compiler.

In order to convert to the new compiler, there are several things
you need to do:
  - edit your make files to change the name of the compiler from CC
    to CL
  - edit your LINK4 command lines to remove all references to the
    ?WLIBC.LIB libraries and any use of the /NODEFAULT switch.
  - be aware that CODEVIEW does NOT work with Windows applications
    and that you must continue to use the SYMDEB program shipped
    with the Windows 1.01 ISV Toolkit.

The following files are included on this disk:

SWINLIBC.LIB - small model library for building Windows library executables.
MWINLIBC.LIB - medium model library for building Windows library executables.
CWINLIBC.LIB - compact model library for building Windows library executables.
LWINLIBC.LIB - large model library for building Windows library executables.
SLIBW.LIB - small model library for building Windows application executables.
MLIBW.LIB - medium model library for building Windows application executables.
CLIBW.LIB - compact model library for building Windows application executables.
LLIBW.LIB - large model library for building Windows application executables.
LINK4.EXE - Segmented-Executable Linker for Windows applications and libraries.

These should be used to replace the corresponding library files in your
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit.  CLIBW.LIB, LLIBW.LIB, CWINLIBC.
LIB and LWINLIBC.LIB are new library files.  All data segments must be fixed
(DATA FIXED specified in .DEF file) when using compact and large model with
Windows.  The old files SWLIB??.LIB, MWLIB??.LIB and LWLIB??.LIB library
files are no longer required since the standard C 4.0 libraries are to be used
instead.  All other Microsoft C runtime libraries that were distributed with
the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit are superseded by those
included in the version 4.0 C runtime libraries.  The -FPa compiler switch is
still required for floating point support.

The new application libraries (SLIBW.LIB, MLIBW.LIB, CLIBW.LIB, LLIBW.LIB)
support the _setargv and _setenvp interfaces.  The default versions of these
procedures, in the C runtime libraries, fill in the __argc, __argv and
environ variables.  If your application does not reference these variables,
then you can eliminate them by defining your own near versions in the _TEXT
segment that do nothing except return to the caller.  Not only will this save
code space, but it will eliminate making a copy of the command line and
environment block in your data segment.  If you do use these variables, but
want to reclaim the data space, then the following will work for a Windows
application:

        environ = free ( environ );
        __argv  = free ( __argv );
        __argc  = 0;

Note that because all Windows applications do NOT receive a copy of the
environment block, but rather a pointer to the environment allocated for the
initial load of WIN100.BIN, the __argv(0) value always points to a string
that contains WIN100.BIN as the file name of the program being run.

Also included on this disk are the sources for a modified version of the
HELLO application that was contained in the Windows 1.01 ISV Toolkit.  The
files listed below give examples of how to build a Windows application for
each of the four memory models (small, medium, compact and large). The HELLO.C
source file contains test code that calls various parts of the standard
Microsoft C runtime library.

HELLO.      - make file that generates SHELLO.EXE, MHELLO.EXE, CHELLO.EXE,
              and LHELLO.EXE,
HELLO.H     - private include file
HELLO.C     - main source file
HELLO.RC    - resource file
HELLO.ICO   - icon
SHELLO.DEF  - small model definitions file
MHELLO.DEF  - medium model definitions file
CHELLO.DEF  - compact model definitions file
LHELLO.DEF  - large model definitions file

If you are using PASCAL to develop your Windows application, then you should
continue to use the C runtime libraries and the PASLIBW.LIB libraries that
were included with the Windows 1.01 ISV Toolkit.

Finally, be aware that the WINDOWS.H file distributed with the Windows 1.01
ISV Toolkit generates two warning messages when compiled with the new
Microsoft C 4.0 compiler.  These warning messages are not fatal, but can be
eliminated by making the following edits to WINDOWS.H:

Replace the definition of NULL on line 62 with the following:

#if (!defined(M_I86CM) && !defined(M_I86LM))
#define  NULL    0
#else
#define  NULL    0L
#endif

Replace the #ifndef on line 1065 with the following:

#ifndef NOWNDCLASS
