This document contains information related to Version 4.0 of the Microsoft C
Compiler and libraries for MS-DOS(R).  The information contained in this
document is more up to date than the printed manuals.  As a result, where
information in the manuals conflicts with information in this document, this
document should be assumed to contain the correct information.


                                 General Notes


NOTE TO WINDOWS DEVELOPERS

This version of the Microsoft C Compiler includes updated libraries.  These
supersede the libraries that are included with the Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit Version 1.01.  The Windows-specific libraries can be found on
the start-up source code disk in a subdirectory named WINLIB.  These libraries
should be used to replace the corresponding files in your Windows Development
Toolkit.  The README.DOC file in the WINLIB subdirectory on the Startup Source
Code disk provides more information on the use of these libraries.



FLOATING-POINT OPERATIONS UNDER DOS 3.2

If you are running IBM(R) PC-DOS 3.20 and trapping floating-point exceptions in
your program, you may find it necessary to patch PC-DOS 3.20 to get proper
operation when floating-point exceptions occur.  Please refer to the file named
PATCH.DOC in the PATCH subdirectory on the Utilities disk for instructions on
making this patch.



                           New and Changed Features


The following lists describe important new and changed features in the
Microsoft C Compiler.  In some cases, the changes fix errors in the previous
compiler and may change the behavior of programs that relied on the erroneous
behavior of the previous compiler.



PACKAGE CONTENTS


A large-model version of C3.EXE named C3L.EXE has been included for users whose
programs have functions that cannot be optimized by the normal (small-model)
C3.EXE because they are too big to fit in 64K of memory.  If you rename C3L.EXE
to C3.EXE and install it with the other compiler passes, you should be able to
optimize much larger functions (depending on your available memory).

The sources for the C start-up are included in the release, along with a MAKE
file and a readme file.  PLEASE NOTE:  These sources are included as a
convenience for users who wish to modify them for some special purpose.
However, Microsoft Technical Support WILL NOT be able to provide support for
questions about modifying these routines, nor do we make any claims of future
compatibility with this code.

New versions of the MOUSE.COM and MOUSE.SYS files are included in the release
for users who use a mouse with the CodeView debugger.  These new versions allow
the CodeView debugger to save the previous state of the mouse cursor whenever
the user changes screens.  Be sure that you substitute the versions of
MOUSE.SYS or MOUSE.COM provided in the release for any earlier versions of
these files.


MSC AND CL DRIVER CHANGES


"Source listing" Prompt

The "Source listing" prompt and its corresponding place in the MSC command line
are new for Microsoft C Version 4.0.  If you are upgrading from Version 3.0,
MSC command lines in batch files or MAKE description files may need to be
revised to work correctly with Version 4.0.  Specifically, if a Version 3.0
command line specifies an object listing, it will produce a source listing
instead with Version 4.0.



/Ze and /Za Options

The /Ze option (enable extended keywords) is now the default, while the /Za
option has been added to explicitly disable extended keywords.  If the /Za
option is used, a new default define is emitted (NO_EXT_KEYS) to indicate that
extended keywords are disabled.

Do not use the /Za option in conjunction with the /Gc option.  If you do so, a
new start-up will be required, and you will not be able to reference C library
functions in your program.



/Gc Option

If you compile with the /Gc option, either you must declare the main function
with the cdecl keyword in your program, or you must change the start-up so that
it uses the correct naming and function-calling conventions when calling
main().



/Zi Option

The /Zi option causes the compiler to emit symbolic-debugging information for
use with the CodeView(TM) debugger.  Note that this information causes a
substantial increase in the size of the corresponding object- and executable-
file sizes.

Optimizations involving code motion or code removal can cause the CodeView
debugger to think that some local symbols are no longer in scope when, in fact,
they are.  As a result, the CodeView debugger treats references to these
symbols as unknown-symbol references.  To avoid this problem, compile your
program with the /Zi option, and do not specify any optimization (/O) options.
Since optimization is enabled by default, this combination of options disables
only code-motion and code-removal optimizations.  If you explicitly specify any
optimization options, all optimizations that are enabled or disabled by those
options are performed.



/D Option

The MSC and CL drivers can now handle more /D options (the maximum is still 20,
but the practical limit used to be much less) and have more directories
specified in the INCLUDE environment variable on the command line without
running into command-line-length limits.  Note that this does not have any
effect on the length of the command line you type when invoking MSC or CL.  The
command line is still bound by the DOS limit of 127 characters.



NEW AND CHANGED ERROR MESSAGES



Bad "FILE=" Parameter in CONFIG.SYS

You should set the "FILES=" parameter in your CONFIG.SYS file to a value
greater than or equal to 20.  If you specify a value less than 20, you may run
out of file handles during compilation.  In some cases, if the compiler tries
to open an include file and is out of file handles, it displays a "Cannot find
file" error message instead of a "No more file handles" error message.



New Error Messages

We have modified the parser to try and correct the "cascade errors" (long lists
of pseudo-errors caused by a single error such as a missing right parenthesis
(")") or semicolon (";") generated by the previous version of the compiler.
This is done using a "token insertion" technique, which tries to insert a valid
token at the point at which the error is detected, in order to recover and
continue in a reasonable manner. Whenever this occurs, the compiler emits one
of the following error messages:

     143: syntax error: missing <token> before <token>
     144: syntax error: missing <token> before type <type_id>
     145: syntax error: missing <token> before identifier
     146: syntax error: missing <token> before identifier <name>

In all cases, the parser inserts the <token> and continues parsing.  This is
still an error, even if the parser inserts the correct token.     The program
will not attempt to generate code after such an error is detected.     The user
must fix the error and recompile.

Another new error message, 147, has been added:

     147 : array : unknown size

This error is similar to error 133, but it handles the case where the array
name is not known, as in the following example:

     extern char (*p)[];
     p++;

Since in this example p is a pointer to an unnamed array of unknown size, p++
cannot be calculated.



Internal and Unknown Error Messages

Fatal, error, and warning messages that should not occur (such as internal
compiler errors and "UNKNOWN ERROR" warning or fatal errors) have been changed
to indicate that the user should contact Microsoft Technical Support.  In the
case of internal compiler errors, the compiler displays the following line:

     (compiler file '<name>', line <number>)

The <name> and <number> values indicate the name of the compiler module in
which the internal error was detected and the line number in that module where
the error was detected.  This information MUST be included in any report to
Microsoft Technical Support.  Note that the line number at which the error is
detected in the user's file is given in the usual place, in parentheses
following the source file name.


New Warning Messages

The following new warning messages have been added:

     warning 73 : Scoping too deep, deepest scoping merged when
     debugging

     warning 74 : non-standard extension used - '<description>'
     
     warning 75 : type of switch expression cannot be long - converted to int

Warning 73 is issued when /Zi is used and the static nesting level is greater
than 13.  Any items declared at levels below this will act as if they are in
the same scope in the program.  Thus, if a variable name is redeclared in a
deep level, you will not be able to access all instances of that variable in
the debugger.

In Microsoft C Version 3.0, several constructs were allowed where the construct
was syntactically illegal but not caught, or where the construct was intended
to be compatible with a part of the then-current draft of the ANSI C standard.
Some of these constructs have been kept in the language but are allowed ONLY if
the Microsoft-specific extensions are enabled (/Ze).

In these cases, if warning level 3 is specified, warning 74 is emitted to
indicate that a nonstandard extension is being used.  Note that this warning is
not displayed for ALL Microsoft-specific extensions (specifically, usage of the
extended keywords), but only for items whose behavior is different from that in
Version 3.0 when extensions are not enabled.  We strongly advise you to rewrite
code that uses any of these extensions, since some of them may be removed in
future versions of Microsoft C.  This will enhance the portability of your
programs now and in the future.

The following six cases produce this warning:

1.   Use of a cast to produce an lvalue, as in the following example:

          int *p;
          ((long *)p)++;

     This construct was allowed in Version 3.0 because of a compiler bug that
     has since been detected.  However, in many cases this is a reasonable (and
     useful) construct, so Microsoft C allows it if the /Ze option is used and
     gives an error otherwise.  Note that your code will be more portable if
     the construct in the example is rewritten as shown below:

          p = (int *)p + sizeof(long);


     In Microsoft C, the code generated for both examples is identical.  Note
     that certain casts that were previously allowed are no longer allowed,
     even with -Ze.  Specifically, casts that would increase the size of an
     object are disallowed, as in the following examples:

          int i;
          (long)i = 0xffff0000L;


          char near *p;
          &((char far *)p)

     However, you can freely cast values to shorter types or cast pointers to
     be pointers (of the same size) to different types and still maintain the
     "lvalueness" of the item.

2.   Redefinition of an extern item as static, as in the following example:

          extern int foo();
          static int foo()
          {}

     This is not allowed by the draft standard, but it is benign in our
     compiler and has some history behind it in the UNIX(TM) world, so we have
     maintained support for it under /Ze.

3.   Use of a trailing comma (",") in a function declaration to indicate
     variable-length argument lists, as in the following example:

          int printf(char *,);

     The draft standard changed after the release of Microsoft C Version 3.0 to
     the ellipsis form (,...).  Microsoft C Version 4.0 supports the new form
     but, for compatibility, also allows the old form to be used if the /Ze
     option is given.

4.   Benign typedef redefinition, as in the following examples:

          typedef int INT;
          typedef int INT;

     The current draft of the ANSI C standard does not allow redefinition of a
     typedef name in the same scope (although it is allowed in inner scopes).
     Microsoft C Version 4.0 allows redefinition in the same scope if the
     typedefs are identical.
     
5.   Macro formal parameters in strings and character constants, as in the
     following example:

          #define print(x) printf("x")

     Use of this feature generates a warning at level 1 (not level 3), as this
     feature will be replaced in the future by an alternative method that is
     provided the ANSI C standard.
     
6.   Mixed character and string constants in an initializer, as in the
     following example:

          char arr[5] = {'a', 'b', "cde"};

     This is the only form of mixed-string initialization that is allowed.  You
     cannot use multiple strings or a string followed by character constants.



New Fatal Error Message

There is one new fatal error message:

     fatal error 50 : code segment '<segment>' too large

This message is displayed whenever a code segment gets within 36 bytes of 64K
in size during compilation.  A 36-byte pad is used because of an bug in some
80286 chips that can cause programs to exhibit strange behavior when, among
other conditions, the size of a code segment is within 36 bytes of 64K.  The
linker outputs a similar message if combining segments causes the size of a
code segment to fall into this range.



LANGUAGE CHANGES


Keywords

You should not use "const" or "volatile" as variable names in your programs.
These words are reserved for future expansion as keywords.



Structure/Union Nesting

The maximum legal number of nested structures/unions has been increased from 5
to 10.



Converting Short Pointers to Long Ints

The conversion of short pointers to long ints has changed to reflect the way
that other values are converted to longer types. In Microsoft C Version 3.0,
the following code would cause p to be converted to a short int, then to a long
int:

          char *p = NULL;
          long i;

          i = (long)p;
          if (i == 0L) {
               . . .
               }

However, all other length-increasing conversions first convert the size, then
convert the mode.  (For example, converting char to unsigned long first
converts the char to signed long, then to unsigned long.)  As a result, in
Microsoft C Version 3.0, the "if" expression in the example was true in this
case.

As a result of the change for Version 4.0, the code in the example first
converts p to a far pointer (by loading the appropriate segment register
value), then changes that to a pointer.  Thus, the "if" expression in the
example would likely fail, since the segment registers do not usually contain
0.



NEW AND CHANGED RUN-TIME LIBRARY FEATURES


Model-Independent Code Helpers

Mixed-model programming support has been enhanced by adding model- independent
code helpers.  That is, calls to long arithmetic helpers such as __lmul and
__ldiv now use model-specific names so that you can mix objects compiled in
different models without running into problems when, for example, one object
expects __lmul to be a near function and one expects it to be far.

Note that this DOES NOT apply to the regular library routines -- they are
always model specific, and you must be wary of how they are used in mixed-model
programs.



Start-Up Code

The start-up has been changed so that it does not use the stack to store the
environment array.  This change will prevent stack-overflow errors on start-up
when very large environments are being used.



Changes to Library Functions


printf and scanf

The printf and scanf families of functions have been extended with new formats.
These new formats include formats from the draft ANSI C standard and Microsoft-
specific formats that allow you to specify pointer/address sizes for formats
that correspond to pointer/address arguments. For example, in a small-model
program, you can pass a far pointer to a string into printf to print the string
as shown in the following example:


     foo(s)
     char far *s;

     {
     printf("%Fs\n", s);
     }

One consequence of this is that, in the scanf family of functions, the %F and
%E formats are no longer supported.  Since these formats were equivalent to the
%f and %e formats, respectively, you can replace them directly without changing
program input or functioning.



rename

The arguments to the rename function have been reversed, so that the function
interface is now defined as shown below:

          int rename(oldname, newname);

This change was adopted in order to conform to the definition in the current
ANSI draft C standard.  The Microsoft version of the rename function was
originally defined before the rename function was included in the library
section of the draft.  You must change any uses of rename in your code and
recompile them before you link with the newest libraries.


signal

The signal function can now trap floating-point exceptions.  There are several
new support routines that can be used by the signal-handling function to clean
up the 8087 or emulator so the program can then be continued (see _fpreset,
_clear87, _status87, and  _control87 in the library reference manual).



spawn

The spawnxx functions have been changed to avoid loading the execxx functions
also unless the P_OVERLAY flag is actually referenced in the source code.  This
change should reduce code size by 2K to 3K for most users of the spawnxx
functions.  If you have code that uses the P_OVERLAY feature, you must
recompile this code before linking it with the newest libraries.



                           Changes to Documentation


The following section describes features that were added or changed after the
documentation was printed.



USER'S GUIDE


Assembly-Listing Files (p. 68)


Assembly-listing files (generated by the /Fa option) cannot be assembled
directly when the C sources include C-common (uninitialized global) variables.
These are denoted in the .ASM listing by a comment line starting ";.comm ..."
Current versions of MASM do not support this concept, and so they are converted
to extern references in the .ASM file.  Simply initializing these options to 0
in the C source code and recompiling with /Fa will fix this problem.



Removing In-Line 8087 Instructions (p. 80)


The Microsoft C Compiler does not have "true" in-line 8087 in the sense that
the code generates software interrupts to library code, which then fixes up the
interrupt to either use the emulator or the 8087.  This can be removed by
simply assembling the following program and linking it with the C program:

     public FIARQQ, FICRQQ, FIDRQQ, FIERQQ, FISRQQ, FIWRQQ
     public FJARQQ, FJCRQQ, FJSRQQ

     FIARQQ    EQU  0
     FICRQQ    EQU  0
     FIDRQQ    EQU  0
     FIERQQ    EQU  0
     FISRQQ    EQU  0
     FIWRQQ    EQU  0
     FJARQQ    EQU  0
     FJCRQQ    EQU  0
     FJSRQQ    EQU  0

     END

Assembling and linking this program with your C program will save execution
time (the time required to patch all the interrupts the first time).  However,
the program will run only if an 8087/287 is present.



Using NULL in Medium and Compact Memory Models (p. 175)

Note that in medium and compact models, NULL must be used carefully in certain
situations.  NULL actually represents a NULL data pointer.  In memory models
where code and data pointers are the same size, it can be used with either.
However, in memory models where code and data pointers are different sizes,
this is not the case.  The example

     func1(dp)
     char *dp;
     {
     ...
     }

     func2(fp)
     char (*fp)();
     {
     ...
     }

     main()
     {
     func1(NULL);
     func2(NULL);
     }

passes a 16-bit pointer to both func1 and func2 if compiled in medium model,
and a 32-bit pointer to both func1 and func2 if compiled in compact model,
UNLESS function declarations are added to the beginning of the program to
indicate the types, or an explicit cast is used on the argument to func1
(compact model) or func2 (medium model).



Customized Memory Models with Near and Far Functions (p. 185)

If you use a customized memory model when compiling a program that uses both
far and near functions, you should be aware of the following issues:

o    The chkstk function should be called ONLY in functions that are compiled
     in the same model as the libraries being used.  For compatibility with
     XENIX(R), the chkstk function name cannot be model encoded.

o    The float-calls interfaces (generated when the /FPc, /FPa, and /FPc87
     options are used in compiling) are not model encoded, so the same
     restriction is placed on functions containing floating-point calls:  they
     must be compiled in the same model as the libraries being used.



XENIX/DOS Portability for Version 4.0 (p. 347)

If you move code between XENIX and DOS, Microsoft C Version 4.0 raises several
issues.  Because the names of code helpers (for example, __almul) have been
changed, users who port objects compiled under Version 4.0 will also have to
move copies of the relevant helper functions from LIBH.LIB to XENIX, since the
current XENIX C compiler and cross-development libraries are from a different
version.

Beware of porting object files that reference the setjmp or longjmp functions
from XENIX to DOS, unless you compiled the object file with the  -dos option.
The DOS versions of these functions use a larger buffer size and may cause
memory to be overwritten.  You can port such object files from DOS to XENIX
without problems, and you can successfully port the corresponding source files
in either direction.



Compiler Limits (p. 409)

Section H.3.5, "Compiler Limits," states that there is a limit of eight actual
arguments to a macro.  This is not true.  There is no fixed limit on the number
of actual arguments to a macro.  However, there are practical limits due to
limitations on macro definition size and expansion.



RUN-TIME LIBRARY REFERENCE MANUAL



SHARE.COM Program

The Library Reference sometimes refers to the DOS program SHARE.COM.  This may
be SHARE.EXE in some versions of DOS.



_amblksiz (p. 31)

The description of this variable should note that adjusting this value affects
only far-heap allocation (for example, standard malloc calls in compact, large,
and huge models, and _fmalloc calls in small and medium models).  However,
adjusting this value has NO effect on halloc or _nmalloc in any model.



chdir (p. 120)

For the chdir function, the current working directory is always relative to the
current default drive.  Thus, if the current working directory is A:\BIN, the
following call does NOT change the current working directory, since DOS does
not change the current default drive when chdir is called:

     chdir ("c:\temp");

To change the current default drive to drive C, call the system function as
shown below:

     system("c:");



chsize (p. 123)

A bug in DOS may cause CHKDSK to report an allocation error after a file is
truncated.  The following sequence of steps causes CHKDSK to report this error:

1.   The file has x + 1 clusters allocated.

2.   It is truncated to x clusters.

3.   A seek is performed to somewhere in cluster x + 1, followed by a write.
     After the file is closed, CHKDSK reports the allocation error.

The only way to avoid this problem from C is to read or write at least 1 byte
before performing a seek.  If the file has read/write access, simply reading a
single character after the truncation is sufficient.  If the file has write-
only access, a 1-byte write can be performed, although this makes the file 1
byte larger.

Note that this error occurs only if the seek past the end-of-file is the first
operation performed on the file after truncation.



fcvt (p. 163), gcvt (p. 221), ltoa (p. 272), memcpy (p. 280), and strlwr (p.
380)

These functions return pointers, so the declarations of these functions under
the "Summary" headings should read

     char *fcvt(value, ndec, decptr, signptr);

     char *gcvt(value, ndec, buffer);

     char *ltoa(value, string, radix);

     char *memcpy(dest, src, cnt);

     char *strlwr(string);

respectively.



fmod (p. 186)

The return value from this function (the floating-point remainder) is not
compatible with the draft ANSI C standard.  However, it is consistent with the
current UNIX System V definition, and it will be changed when the Microsoft C
Compiler fully conforms with the ANSI draft C standard or when the System V
definition is changed.



halloc (p. 236)

The halloc function also returns NULL if the allocation request cannot be
satisfied for reasons other than lack of available memory, such as an illegally
specified huge array (for example, trying to allocate a 50000-element array of
6-byte items).



int86x (p. 243) and intdosx (p. 248)

In the descriptions of the int86x and intdosx functions, change the line

     After the interrupt returns, the function copies the current register
     values to outregs and restores DS.

so that it reads

     After the interrupt returns, the function copies the current register
     values to outregs, copies the current ES and DS values to segregs, and
     restores DS.



lfind and lsearch (p. 259)

In the descriptions of these functions, change the "Return Values" section to
read as follows:

     If the key is found, both lsearch and lfind return a pointer to that
     element of the array pointed to by base.  Otherwise, lsearch returns a
     pointer to a newly added item at the end of the array, and lfind returns
     NULL.



malloc (p. 273)

The malloc(0) fragment does NOT return NULL, but instead allocates a zero-
length item (that is, a header only) in the heap.  The resulting pointer may be
passed to the realloc function to adjust the size at any time.



memicmp (p. 281), stricmp (p. 373), and strnicmp (p. 381)


These functions all convert alphabetic characters to lowercase before
performing comparisons.  Thus, the following fragment returns a value greater
than 0:

     stricmp("A", "_")



movedata (p. 288)

In the "Summary," the srcseg, scrcoff, destseg, and destoff arguments should
all be declared as unsigned int, not int.



_nmsize (p. 295)

The ptr argument should be declared as "char near *ptr", not "char near ptr".



open (p. 298)

Because of a bug in DOS Versions 2.0 and 2.1, attempts to open a device (such
as CON) sometimes succeed and sometimes fail.  This inconsistent behavior also
occurs if the stdio-level file-open functions (such as fopen) are used.  The
bug is fixed in DOS Version 3.0 and subsequent versions.

When opening a file with open, one of the access modes (O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or
O_RDWR) MUST be specified.  It does NOT default.

When a file is opened in text mode, ^Z is interpreted as an end-of-file file
character on input.  Also, when files are opened for writing (or
reading/writing) in text mode, the run time checks for a ^Z at the end of the
file and removes it if possible.  Using the fseek and ftell functions in
combination to move around a ^Z-terminated text file can cause improper
behavior in fseek near the end of the file.



perror (p. 303) and strerror (p. 377)

In the "Summary" for both of these functions, the sys_errlist argument should
be declared as follows:

     char *sys_errlist[sys_nerr];



pow (p. 305)

Under "Return Value," change the sentence

     If x is 0 and y is negative, pow sets errno to ERANGE...

so that it reads

     If x is 0 and y is negative, pow sets errno to EDOM...

This change reflects the current ANSI draft C standard.

Also change the sentence

     If x is negative and y is is not an integer, the function prints...

so that it reads


     If both x and y are 0, or if x is negative and y is is not an integer, the
     function prints...




The pow function does not recognize integral, floating-point values greater
than 2 to the 64th power.  (For example, 1.0E100 is NOT recognized as an
integral value.)  The return value has been changed to be compatible with the
ANSI draft C standard.



printf (p. 306)

If printf is called with a floating-point format specifier and the
corresponding argument is infinite, indefinite, or not-a-number, the output
from printf will look as follows:

          Value               Output
          -----               ------
          +infinity           1.#INF<random digits>
          -infinity           -1.#INF<random digits>
          indefinite          <digit>.#IND<random digits>
          not-a-number        <digit>.#NAN<random digits>

The Microsoft C version of the printf function is incompatible with the draft
ANSI C standard, since it does not allow negative field-width and precision
specifiers.



putenv (p. 316)

Note that the environment manipulated by putenv is local to the process
currently running.  You cannot enter new items in your command-level
environment using putenv.  When the program terminates, the environment reverts
to the environment of the parent process (the DOS level, in most cases).
However, this environment is passed on to any child processes that are spawned
(exec'ed), and they set any new items added by putenv.



rename (p. 329)

The capability to rename directories is available only when running DOS 3.x.



scanf (p. 336)

The input for a %x format specifier is always interpreted as a hex number; the
leading 0x (0X) is not needed as it is in the language.  Thus, if the input is
0xffff, the result returned from scanf is 0, since x is not a valid hex
character.  The correct input would be ffff.  If the data file contains leading
0x (0X) characters, the correct format specifier is "...0x%x".



signal (p. 350)

Change the function declaration under the "Summary" heading so that it reads as
follows:

     int (*signal(sig,func))();



sopen (p. 354)

Contrary to the list under "Return Values," this function does NOT return
EINVAL if SHARE is not installed.  It does not detect whether SHARE is
installed.  If SHARE is not installed, DOS simply ignores the sharing mode.



spawnl - spawnvpe (p. 358)

Contrary to the "Note" under the "Return Value" heading, the spawn functions DO
pass on to the child process all information on open files, including the
translation mode, through the environment passed to the child.  A special entry
called ";C_FILE_INFO" is passed to the child.  It is normally processed and
deleted from the environment by the C start-up code.  However, if spawnxx is
used to spawn a non-C process (such as COMMAND.COM) this entry will still be in
the environment.  Also, since the information is passed in binary form,
printing the environment will show graphics characters in the definition string
for this entry. It should not have any other effect on normal operations.



strcspn (p. 373) and strspn (p. 388)

These functions return unsigned integer values, not integer values, so the
declarations of these functions under the "Summary" headings should read

     unsigned int strcspn(string1, string2);

     unsigned int strspn(string1, string2);

respectively.



strerror (p. 378)

In the example for this function, change the lines

     strerror ("open failed on input file");

     strerror ("open failed on output file");

so that they read

     printf("%s\n",strerror ("open failed on input file"));

     printf("%s\n",strerror ("open failed on output file"));

respectively.



strstr (p. 389)

The "Description" and "Return Value" sections should read as follows:

     Description
     
     The strstr function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string2
     in string1.
     
     Return Value
     
     The strstr function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string2
     in string1, and NULL if it does not find string2 in string1.



tmpnam - tempnam (p. 401)

In the description of these functions, line 2 of the first paragraph of the
"Description" section should read as follows:

     If string is NULL, then tmpnam leaves the result in an internal static
     buffer.  Thus, any subsequent calls will destroy this value.

In the "Condition/Directory" list, if P_tmpdir does not exist, tempnam uses the
current working directory as a last-resort place to create the temporary file.

A note should be added that tempnam uses malloc to allocate space for the
created file name, and the user is responsible for freeing this space when it
is no longer needed.



tzset (p. 407)

In declaration of this function under "Summary," change the line

     char *tzname[2]l

so that it reads

     char *tzname[2];



va_arg - va_start (p. 419)

Under the "Summary" heading, add the following #include directive to the
header:

     #include <stdio.h>



CODEVIEW REFERENCE MANUAL


Using the CodeView Debugger with the IBM PC Convertible

To use the CodeView debugger with the IBM PC Convertible, you must start the
CodeView debugger with the /D, /W, and /M options.  (The /D option is described
under "New Options" below.)


Using the CodeView Debugger with Assembly-Language Programs

When writing stand-alone assembler programs that will be debugged with the
CodeView debugger, the class type for the code segment must be 'CODE'. For
example, declare segments as follows:

     sseg   SEGMENT para stack 'STACK'
     sseg   ENDS

     dseg   SEGMENT word public 'DATA'
     dseg   ENDS

     cseg   SEGMENT byte public 'CODE'
     cseg   ENDS


The CodeView debugger is more limited when debugging assembler programs than
when debugging C programs. The following limitations apply:

o    The assembler does not write line numbers to the object file. Therefore,
     assembled programs cannot be debugged in source mode. The source file can
     be loaded and viewed in source mode, but you must switch to assembly mode
     to debug.

o    The assembler does not write information on the type size of each variable
     to the object file. Therefore, you cannot use variables in CodeView
     expressions (you can still use constants). This means that the Display
     Expression command, the Watchpoint command, and the expression versions of
     the Watch and Tracepoint commands do not work for assembled programs.
     Instead, use the Dump command and the memory versions of the Watch and
     Tracepoint commands.

     For example, assume your program has the following declaration:

          var_a   DW  30d

     You can use the following commands with this variable:

          DI var_a L 1  ;* Dump var_a as an integer
          WI var_a L 1  ;* Watch var_a as an integer
          TPI var_a     ;* Break when var_a changes (length 1 is default)

o    Symbol names are normally converted to uppercase when assembled. If
     symbols in your source file are lowercase, you may want to turn off Case
     Sense from the Options menu.

o    Procedures will be shown on the Calls menu or with the Stack Trace command
     only if they use the Microsoft calling conventions (see Chapter 10 of the
     Microsoft C Compiler User's Guide). Similarly, local variables can only be
     accessed if they are stored in the same way as in Microsoft high-level
     languages.

o    To view global symbols, you must specify the module. For example, use
     "X?<module>.*" rather than "X?*".


New Options

The following new CodeView options have been added:


    Option                        Purpose
    ------                        -------

     /2                 Allows two video adapters. You must have two video
                        adapters and two monitors. The program display appears
                        on the current default adapter and monitor, while the
                        debugging display appears on the other adapter and
                        monitor. For example, if you have both a Color Graphics
                        Adapter and a Monochrome Adapter, you might want to set
                        the CGA up as the default adapter. You could then debug
                        a graphics program with the graphics display appearing
                        on the graphics monitor and the debugging display
                        appearing on the monochrome adapter. Microsoft Mouse
                        support will be disabled on the debugging display if
                        you use this option.
     
     /D                 Turns off certain IBM-specific functions, including NMI
                        trapping and 8259 masking. This option is required for
                        IBM-compatible machines that do not support these
                        functions, such as the IBM PC Convertible, the Tandy
                        1000, and the AT&T 6300 Plus. CONTROL-C and CONTROL-
                        BREAK do not work if this option is used. Sequential
                        mode is set automatically; use /W with /D to enable
                        window mode.
     /I                 Forces the debugger to handle certain IBM-specific
                        functions, including NMI trapping and 8259 masking.
                        This option can be used to enable CONTROL-C and
                        CONTROL-BREAK handling on computers that the debugger
                        does not recognize as being IBM compatible, such as the
                        Eagle PC. Window mode is set automatically; you do not
                        have to specify /W.


Compatibility With Other Programs

     Sidekick
          
          There is a problem with Sidekick that may cause improper operation
          while running in the CodeView debugger.  Sidekick improperly restores
          the video parameters on return; using the Redraw command (@) after
          returning from Sidekick may correct the problem.

     Superkey

          The CodeView debugger traps the keyboard interrupt so that the
          CONTROL-C,  CONTROL-BREAK, and SYS REQ keys will function as
          interactive breakpoints. As a result, Superkey does not work in the
          CodeView debugger. The same problem may occur with other  keyboard-
          enhancer programs.



Control Keys

Control-S will not work on non-IBM machines, since the CodeView debugger does
not perform its output through DOS.



Display

The CodeView debugger does not recognize symbols for C labels, and it does not
work correctly for include files that contain executable code.



Breakpoint on No-Code Lines

The manual indicates that the CodeView debugger will attempt to set a
breakpoint on the next-closest line if the specified line has no executable
code associated with it. The CodeView debugger will actually display an error
message.



Case-Sensitivity Option

The Case Sense item from the Options menu only applies to symbol-table lookup.
It does not apply to regular expression searches using the Search menu.



Assembly and Unassembly

Occasionally when code is displayed in assembly mode or with the  Unassemble
command, code similar to the following will be shown:

     FE30 ??? Byte Ptr [DI]

These are instructions that Intel(R) recommends against using, since there are
equivalent opcodes and the instruction may not work properly on all machines.
You should not see this type of code under normal circumstances, unless you are
disassembling data.

The CodeView debugger cannot assemble 8087/80287 instructions.



Stack Trace

To make it easier to debug assembly-language programs, the stack-trace function
(and Calls menu) try to display the stack frame in assembly-language routines.
As a result, the last function in the stack trace is __astart rather than
_main, as described in the manual.



                          Reporting Compiler Problems


When reporting problems with the compiler we ask that you please provide the
following information to help us in tracking down the problem:

o    The compiler version number (from the logo that is printed out when you
     invoke the compiler using the MSC or CL command)

o    The version of DOS you are running (use the DOS VER command)

o    Your system configuration (which machine, total memory, total free memory
     at compiler execution time)

o    The command line used in the compilation

o    A preprocessed listing of the program (produced using the /E, /P, or /EP
     option), or if the problem appears to be in the preprocessor, the C
     source(s) and ALL include files referenced

o    All objects/libraries (except standard ones, but please state which
     standard objects/libraries you are using) needed to link, if necessary

Having that information will be of immense help to us in solving your problem
quickly.
